      <h1 className="story-title">Sarah Colbert: Life Coach</h1>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        When I first sat down to interview Sarah Colbert, we expected to hear
        the typical story of someone who had always dreamed of becoming a life
        coach. Instead, we were surprised to learn that her journey began in a
        very different place: she originally wanted to become a therapist.
        During her undergraduate years, though, she discovered life coaching and
        quickly realized it aligned more naturally with how she wanted to help
        people. Unlike therapy, which often explores a client’s past, coaching
        focuses on the present, on the decisions, habits, and patterns that
        shape someone’s daily life. That shift in perspective was exactly what
        drew her in.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        She explained that she works with people of all ages, whether it be
        young adults or middle-aged parents. Her coaching style centers on
        helping clients function better in the world they live in, rather than
        unpacking everything they’ve lived through. This approach comes from a
        deeply personal place. She was a single parent for many years, trying to
        hold everything together while feeling like she had barely any support.
        Therapy didn’t work for her during that time, but coaching did, and that
        experience became an anchor for everything she does now.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        One of her biggest driving forces is the moment when a client realizes
        something important about themselves. She has become an expert in
        noticing and calling attention to clients’ patterns, especially the ones
        clients don’t see themselves, repeat without seeing them. She admitted
        that it can seem harsh in the moment, but later the client always comes
        back grateful for the honesty. That kind of directness is part of why
        she built such a strong client base early on, starting with connections
        she made at church and during her undergraduate internship. From there,
        her practice grew mostly through word of mouth.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        Even though life coaching may seem like a field with loose boundaries,
        she emphasized that proper training is essential. Certification takes
        about a year, and she warned about people who claim to be life coaches
        without doing any real training at all. The early years of her business
        were far from easy, years one through four were filled with moments
        where she wanted to give up. Listening to clients’ struggles was often
        heavy, especially when their stories reminded her of her own. She told
        us she had to “coach herself through” many of those moments.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        When her clients struggled with deeper, clinical issues—especially
        personality disorders—she partnered with psychiatrists and therapists
        because she understood her limits. “Ask for help when you need it,” she
        said simply. She credits asking help from other coaches, from parenting
        coaches to business coaches, for helping her stay persistent and able.
        Without them, she believes she wouldn’t have made it through.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        The analogy she shared stuck with us: if someone is drowning in a pool,
        jumping in after them will only drown you too. A good coach stands at
        the edge and helps pull them out. She’s lived through enough to know her
        clients can survive too.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        Speaking with her made us realize how valuable honesty and boundaries
        are in any helping profession. Her advice, to just try and give yourself
        a year before judging the outcome, felt surprisingly empowering. It’s a
        reminder that trying isn’t failing; it’s the first step toward figuring
        out who you want to become.
