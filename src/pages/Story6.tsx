      <h1 className="story-title">Chelsea Burnett: Storm Science</h1>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        {" "}
        Growing up in central Oklahoma, right in the heart of Tornado Alley,
        Chelsea Burnett's childhood didn’t look like most people’s. While other
        kids were running inside during thunderstorms, she was the two-year-old
        sprinting out the front door every time thunder shook the house. Her
        parents knew early on that something about storms captivated her, but
        none of them realized just how big a role weather would play in her
        life.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        As she got older, her interest turned into ambition. She became more
        aware of meteorology and decided she wanted to become a storm chaser or
        pursue something that connected her to weather. To make that happen, she
        pushed herself academically, focusing on math and science with the goal
        of attending the University of Oklahoma for meteorology. But her path
        wasn’t as straightforward as she once imagined. She failed Calculus I
        three semesters in a row, and suddenly the dream that once felt so
        certain had to be paused. She redirected, choosing to pursue business at
        UNT, a decision that eventually helped her become the entrepreneur she
        is today.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Even though she took a different academic path, her love for storms
        never disappeared. In fact, her passion grew stronger. Every storm, she
        explained, is completely different, its own mystery, its own equation of
        variables, which is what keeps her hooked. Storm chasing has taken her
        to places she never would have visited otherwise, including stretches of
        land “in the middle of nowhere” in the nation that she’s come to love.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Her personal life became intertwined with her passion when she met Adam,
        her spouse, who is also a storm chaser. Adam Lucio and a couple of
        friends created programs that allowed kids to learn about weather
        hands-on, which eventually grew into Storm Science—originally focused in
        Chicago. Meanwhile, she had been helping with the Texas Storm Chasers
        program since 2018, treating it as a side hobby while maintaining a
        stable insurance job.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Then came the moment that changed everything: Nick Bartholomew, a
        colleague from the storm-chasing community, encouraged her to quit her
        steady job and launch Storm Science in Texas. For her, it was an easy
        yes, despite how hard it was to leave coworkers she cared about. The
        early stages were rocky: financially unstable, few bookings, and the
        sudden realization that she should have marketed more before launching.
        But with time, experience, and support from Adam, her foundation grew
        stronger.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        One thing she didn’t expect was how often kids assumed the storm chaser
        walking into their school would be a man. Watching their confusion turn
        into shock when they realized she was the one leading the program became
        a regular occurrence but she felt great knowing she was breaking the
        stereotype. Parents often tell her their children no longer fear storm
        warnings after learning from her, proof of the difference she’s making.
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Despite being introverted and overcoming stuttering, she now speaks
        confidently to groups of kids, families, libraries, and schools. She’s
        learned to step outside her comfort zone, while still scheduling time to
        recharge and spend with her son, one of the perks of being her own boss.
        Her advice to future female entrepreneurs was simple but powerful: “Go
        for it. There are so many resources. Just try, you’ll find your way.”
      </p>
      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Talking to her made us realize how passion doesn’t always follow a
        linear path. Her story shows that failure isn’t the end of a dream;
        sometimes it’s the detour that leads you exactly where you’re meant to
        go. Her courage to start over, and to chase literal storms, is something
        we shall carry with me.
