      <p className="story-paragraph">
        "It's in my blood to start working.. on making something of my own and
        making a difference in society."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Ayesha Iftikhar is the founder of AI Designs, a graphic design company
        that provides branding and design services to businesses looking to
        grow.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Iftikhar didn't originally start off as an entrepreneur: she started her
        career as a graphic designer 12 years ago, and thought she would move up
        her career line with the goal of becoming a creative director and art
        director. "Having kids really changed my perception and life," Iftikhar
        said, "I wanted to give focus to my kids and family, but I did not want
        to compromise my career and all the hard work I put in."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Iftikhar's father was a business owner. "My husband always said, you
        have it in your blood," Iftikhar said. With COVID and the effects of the
        pandemic, Iftikhar wanted the stability and flexibility that came with
        having her own boss and hours, especially so she could be there for her
        family. But Iftikhar was also looking for creative flexibility and how
        she could make a difference in society.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        So, she started her own business, AI Designs, a play on her initials. At
        this point Artificial Intelligence was booming, and paired with her
        unique and creative business, AI Designs gathered intrigue. Ifithkas
        uses Adobe and their integrated AI tools, like FireFly. With AI image
        generation tools, she is able to create the exact image in mind and edit
        through photoshop. It "saves time," Iftikhar said, and "makes the work
        process more productive."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        There was "a lot of time and effort to start something of your own from
        scratch." Iftikhar said. Iftikhar faced a few challenges starting off
        with "getting clients, networking, and [having] sustainable revenue."
        Most of all, Iftikhar did not want to compromise on the quality of her
        work.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Throughout the journey, what kept Iftikhar going was internalizing the
        quote: the people who are doing it, it is not that they are better than
        you, but that they didn't give up. "You think it is easy to quit because
        you had a full time job.. a check.. consistent revenue" Ifitkhas said,
        "but not giving up was the key." Additionally, Iftikhar's family kept
        her going. "My husband said you are an entrepreneur," Iftikhar said, and
        "my patterns were very motivating and very proud of her."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        However, being a mom and woman entrepreneur comes with both its own
        challenges and perks. "It means wearing so many hats at the same time,"
        Iftikhar said. "You are a mom, [and] you have to make sure so many
        things are running at the same time without compromising on the
        business." It requires balancing many different aspects while still
        "taking care of yourself and making sure needs are met," Iftikhar
        explained.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        In terms of business, Ifitkhar emphasized the importance of having a
        presence, finding out your niche and how you stand out when starting
        out. As a woman entrepreneur, Iftikhar found that she wanted to work
        with women entrepreneurs specifically to help them grow. Additionally,
        Iftikhar mentioned that networking was very important for "building
        trust and building connection."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Iftikhar hopes to work with more purpose driven organizations who are
        working for a cause and making a difference. Her goal is to have an
        impact with the local community, especially working with the city of
        Frisco and the various opportunities to make a difference. Ifitkahr
        enjoys being involved with local projects, as "it is more rewarding when
        you see the work locally recognized." Hence, Iftikhar emphasizes the
        importance of working with the community through "local networking
        events" and finding the right clients.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Iftikhar is most proud when seeing the final product of her work with
        her clients. "The end result is a brand book.. and the end result is
        rewarding," Iftikhar said, especially when "they like the work.. and
        come back." She likes working with organizations who serve a purpose and
        make an impactful change, not just selling a product. She recalls
        working with a psychiatrist, and she enjoyed the process of designing a
        brand that reflected the values of "spreading self awareness, self
        care.. making it look calming."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Her advice for future young entrepreneurs: don't be afraid to start.
        "The youth has so much potential, [and] a lot of times the jobs suppress
        this," she explained, "when they have their own thing, there is more
        room to grow and utilize their potential to the max." Even if it is
        something on the side, Iftikhar advises, "it helps you to expand your
        brain."{" "}
