      <h1 className="story-title">Janak Narayan: Artist</h1>
      <p className="story-paragraph">"Art is me. Art is Janak." </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Janak Narayan's mother gifted her first box of paints when she was
        around ten years old. She hasn't looked back since then.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        For Narayan, art is her essence. But Narayan is not just an artist: she
        is an art entrepreneur, or an "artpreneur," as she coined. In addition
        to an MBA in finance, Narayana received a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts
        from Indiana University in 2010. 2025 marks her 10th anniversary as a
        professional artist, and in addition to her art business, she has gone
        back to her finance roots with her work in New York Life.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Narayan's works are primarily nature-inspired with a post-Impressionist
        style. For her artistic process, there is no part she can find herself
        liking more than the other, as art is an "intrinsic joy of her person."
        With every piece she creates, Narayan works to make an "intrinsically
        beautiful piece of art" over pieces resembling each other; like those of
        an assembly line. Narayan said she"tries to make [the piece] one notch
        better than the previous."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        "On one side", Narayan said, "there is a prolific artist who is trying
        to get better daily." At the same time, Narayan has to consider the
        business, exhibitions and art sales, and solo shows. In other words,
        being a professional artist means that she has to make sure that her art
        will have revenue.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        To find balance between being creative and ensuring revenue, Narayan
        advises anyone who wants to be an artist and an entrepreneur to not
        "budge from your passion and do not make something… [just] because it is
        supposed to sell." Narayan emphasized that "what is commercial will not
        always be your passion." She says to make things that make you happy,
        even if you have to start with smaller sizes. However, this can mean
        that you might not have more revenue at certain times, but Narayan is
        proof that over time, you will be able to grow your business.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Narayan's art is made with passion and what she loves is how every
        unique painting has the artist's story. She said, "because it is made
        with passion.. every facet [of the painting] has something different."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Narayan sees art everywhere. Narayan uses her photographs, as her art is
        her life. She enjoys traveling, even where she lives, inspired by the
        nature around her. "I am intently looking at things around me," Narayan
        said. "I take pictures of trees.. buildings."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        While she was getting her Fine Arts degree, Narayan enjoyed the time she
        studied abroad, where she taught workshops in Germany and Dubai. Narayan
        learned from artists all over the world, like Ireland, France, and
        England.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Travel has continued to play a large part in her process. Naryaan is
        constantly learning something, whether that be Kerala murals from when
        she traveled to India to learn folk art, or when she learns from other
        artists across the world through workshops every year.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        However, being a professional artist comes with many challenges. "For
        people to accept you as a professional vs. just a hobbyist," Narayan
        said, is one of the main challenges she faces. Narayan says that her
        degree helps validate the fact that she is a professional, though she
        does have to remind people that it is not hobby income, but a small
        business woman working for success.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Consistency is another challenge of making art a business, according to
        her. One part is ensuring consistency of revenue. For the first few
        years, people need to want an artist's work. From there, once people
        learn about and accept their work, the goal is to make sure revenue
        stays consistent. The other part comes from making art consistently and
        working on marketing, social media, and supplies. Every day, Narayan
        does something for her business, whether that be marketing, or art
        making in the studio, where she spends 70% of that time.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        On top of the challenges that come from being an artpreneur, are the
        challenges that come from being a woman small business owner and/or
        entrepreneur. "Just being a woman in today's world is an upward
        challenge," Narayan said. Many of the challenges faced by women artists
        are the same for other business women. Particularly, gaining support,
        acceptance, and validation. However, artists face few unique hurdles
        with popular perception. "Art is oftentimes looked down upon," Narayan
        said, and there can be "the subtle perception that somebody running an
        art business" is not on par with someone running a big tech company or
        so.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        "If you overcome these challenges, you will be successful," Narayan
        said.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        There were times where it was overwhelming. Narayan spends time taking
        care of her grandson and was a caregiver for her in-laws. When
        exhibitions occur and everything is happening at the same time, it can
        feel like too much is on the plate. But Narayan is unwavering, and is
        incredibly hard working. "With so much going," Narayan said, "it is
        imperative to put time into making the art."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Additionally, Narayan stressed the importance of a support system and
        community. Her mantra: "find the right people, let them lean on you, and
        you lean on them." Narayan thanks her husband, her life-partner, for
        being the key factor in her being able to try everything. "My family has
        been the best critic and the best support," she said. Narayan also
        emphasizes the importance of art community.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Narayan's main advice for any artist looking to make their work a
        business is to just get started. "Jump into it, don't think too much,"
        Narayan said. "You don't suddenly become a professional, you start slow,
        you could be having another job, or be a student… you just start showing
        you work." The four things she advises to anyone starting out are to
        collect a body of work, start creating, meet new artists, and join an
        art community. "If it comes from your heart, it will be good.. and there
        will be the right group of people who will appreciate it, you just have
        to be patient."{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="story-paragraph">
        Overall, Narayan is most proud of being able to create, to be just as
        excited to be an artist every new day, and her proudest moments include
        winning awards and seeing her art displayed. "When people spend money to
        see my artwork everyday," Narayan said, "this makes me feel humble."{" "}
      </p>
